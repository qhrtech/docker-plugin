    <p>For all connection methods, Jenkins will start by triggering a <code>docker run</code>.
        Then, after this step, there will optionally be more steps to establish the connection.
        There is currently three alternative ways to connect your Jenkins master
        to the dynamically provisioned Docker agents.
    </p>

    <p>There are different pros and cons for each connection method. Depending on your environment, choose the one matching your needs. More detailed
        prerequisites are provided once you select a given method.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Attach Docker container</dt>
        <dd>This method runs a container, then connects to it using <code>docker exec</code>,
            all by using the Docker API.
            The agent does not need to be able to reach the master through the network layers
            to communicate ; all will go through Docker API.
        </dd>

        <dt>Connect with JNLP</dt>
        <dd>The container will only be passed an initial <code>docker run</code> command with the right secret.
        And the remoting agent will establish the connection with the master through the network.
        Hence, the agent must be able to access the master through its address and port.</dd>

        <dt>Connect with SSH</dt>
        <dd>The specified image is expected to run an SSH server.
            Then, it will treat that computer like it usually does for any SSH connected agent:
            the master will log into it, copy the remoting agent, then start it.
        </dd>
    </dl>
