Use a dedicated key pair (based on Jenkins master unique Identity) automatically injected in container for SSH authentication.
    <br/>
If you use a non standard <code>sshd</code>, or provide a custom container command, this might not work. You will then
need to disable this option and configure a key pair credentials accordingly.
<b>Not recommended</b> if you don't hit such an issue: a private key stored into container image is a major security issue.
