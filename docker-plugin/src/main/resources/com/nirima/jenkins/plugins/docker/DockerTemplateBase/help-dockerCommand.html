    If you need your image to start some additional services, you should consider using an Entrypoint, and
    follow <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/dockerfile_best-practices/#entrypoint">best practices</a>
    so that the command is eventually executed by your entrypoint script.
